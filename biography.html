        <p>&emsp;Nayvadius DeMun Cash (né Wilburn; born November 20, 1983), known professionally as Future, is an American rapper and singer.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Known for his mumble-styled vocals and prolific output, Future is considered a pioneer of the use of auto-tuned melodies in modern trap music. Due to the sustained popularity of this musical style, he is commonly regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.</p>

        <p>&emsp;The albums contained the platinum-certified singles "Turn On the Lights", "Honest", "Move That Dope" (featuring Pharrell Williams and Pusha T), and "I Won" (featuring Kanye West). His subsequent projects have each peaked the US Billboard 200 and saw continued success upon release.</p>

        <p class="title">Early life</p>
        <img src="images/Chsc.jpg" class="life_img" alt="Columbia Higj School" title="Columbia Higj School">
        <p>  &emsp;Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn was born on November 20, 1983, in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended Columbia High School in Decatur. At age sixteen (c. 1999/2000), Future described getting shot in the hand and robbed, an event he regards as a major turning point in his life.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Future began his career under the name "Meathead" as a member of the Georgia-based musical collective Dungeon Family. He performed in a smaller hip hop group within the collective who went by the name "Da Connect", where he would later be nicknamed "The Future" by group member G-Rock. The group recorded one album, Rico Wade Presents: Da Connect which was slated for commercial release in 2003, but was ultimately shelved. Future had one solo record on the project titled "Belly of da Beast", which is considered to be his first song.</p>
        <p>&emsp;His first cousin, record producer and Dungeon Family member Rico Wade, encouraged him to sharpen his writing skills and pursue a career as a rapper, as recording would create temporary respite from street life. During this time, Future appeared in numerous Dungeon Family music videos, and received his first songwriting credit on the Organized Noize-produced single, "Blueberry Yum Yum" for rapper Ludacris in 2004. Future voices his praise of Wade's musical influence and instruction, calling him the "mastermind" behind his sound. He was thereafter discovered by fellow Atlanta rapper Rocko, who took Future under his wing as a solo artist on his A1 Recordings record label.</p>
